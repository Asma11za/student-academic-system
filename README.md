<h2> About </h2> 

This project aims to develop a Student Grade and Academic Performance Tracking System. For both teachers and students, keeping track of and controlling academic performance in the fast-paced world of education is essential. With the Student Grade and Academic Performance Tracking System, grading can be done faster, student development can be tracked, and parent-teacher communication can be improved.
<br><br>
(*Note): The system was developed using two programming languages: Python and Java. for comparison purposes. 

<h2> Project Goals </h2>

- Improve the efficiency of grading.
- Enable student development tracking.
- Enhance parent-teacher communication.
- Streamline grade management.
- Track student performance.
- Enhance communication within the educational landscape.

<h2> Limitations/Restrictions </h2>

There are several features and capabilities of the system lacking, which may restrict its effectiveness and usability.
<br>
1. Data privacy and security are essential when it comes to student data, given the sensitive nature of that information. Which may not be the case with the current system.
2. It lacks multilingual support or accessibility features for users with disabilities.

 


<h2> Language used: </h2>

- Python 
- Java
